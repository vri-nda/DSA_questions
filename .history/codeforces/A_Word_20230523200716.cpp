// Vasya is very upset that many people on the Net mix uppercase and lowercase letters in one word. 
// That's why he decided to invent an extension for his favorite browser that would change the letters'
//  register in every word so that it either only consisted of lowercase letters or, vice versa, only of
//   uppercase ones. At that as little as possible letters should be changed in the word. For example,
//    the word HoUse must be replaced with house, and the word ViP â€” with VIP. 
//    If a word contains an equal number of uppercase and lowercase letters, you should replace all the letters with lowercase
//     ones. For example, maTRIx should be replaced by matrix. Your task is to use the given method on one given word.
