// Problem
// Chef prepared two dishes yesterday. Chef had assigned the \textbf{tastiness}tastiness T1 and T2 
// to the first and to the second dish respectively. The tastiness of the dishes can be any integer between
//  0 and N (both inclusive).

// Unfortunately, Chef has forgotten the values of T1 and T2
// that he had assigned to the dishes. However, he remembers the sum of the tastiness of both the dishes - denoted by S.

// Chef wonders, what can be the maximum possible absolute difference between the tastiness of the two dishes. 
// Can you help the Chef in finding the maximum absolute difference?

// It is guaranteed that at least one pair {T1, T2}
//exist such that T1 + T2 = S, 0 <=T1, T2 <=N
